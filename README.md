#OCI-Inspector

A collection of scripts and other little things that I wrote to help learn OCI infrastructure.

## public_ips
Walk all compartments of a tenant, interrogate all VCNs that the initiating user has access to and print out the public IP addresses as well as the ingress rules defined for each of them

## compartment_tree
Print out a heirarchical view of the compartments for the configured tenant.
